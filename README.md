**Important note about localhosts**: these executables are red-flagged by antivirus tools as __potentially malicious softwares__, this happens due to the reverse engineering methods that were applied onto these software artifacts. Those depicted here have been put to use for years already and posed no harm so far, so they are soundly assumed to be safe.

HeavenClient Github: https://github.com/ryantpayton/HeavenClient

### Installing the CLIENT 

#### Setting up client-side ambient

The client's set-up is quite straightforward:

1. From "ManagerMsv83.exe", install MapleStory on your folder of preference (e.g. "C:\Nexon\MapleStory") and follow their instructions.
2. Once done, erase these files: "HShield" (folder), "ASPLnchr.exe", "MapleStory.exe" and "Patcher.exe".
3. Extract into the client folder the "localhost.exe" from the provided link.
4. Overwrite the original WZ files with the ones provided from either one of those folders on the Google Drive:
	- "commit???_wz" (last published RELEASE, referring to commit of same number).
	- "current_wz" (latest source update).
