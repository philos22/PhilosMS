## Download these:
Hamachi server: Google this (easy peasy) and register/log in
WZ files: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SIbRHmtV-kBfbZ4eEhbnspiNgWAMd1O7/view?usp=sharing

**Important note about client file PhilosMS.exe**: these executables are red-flagged by antivirus tools as __potentially malicious softwares__, this happens due to the reverse engineering methods that were applied onto these software artifacts. Those depicted here have been put to use for years already and posed no harm so far, so they are soundly assumed to be safe.

## Install
1. From "ManagerMsv83.exe", install MapleStory on your folder of preference (e.g. "C:\Nexon\MapleStory") and follow their instructions.
2. Once done, erase these files: "HShield" (folder), "ASPLnchr.exe", "MapleStory.exe" and "Patcher.exe".
3. Move the "PhilosMS.exe" file into your Maplestory folder
4. Overwrite the original WZ files with the ones provided (copy paste contents from above folder current_wz)

## Connect to server using Hamachi
